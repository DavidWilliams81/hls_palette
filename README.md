# hls_palette
A Hue-Lightness-Saturation (HLS) based palette for MagicaVoxel

This script generates a MagicaVoxel palette based on a series of slices through the HLS (aka HSL) colour model. I find this more organised than the default palette, while also providing the light and dark colours which are missing from some other hue-based palettes. The generated disks do not include pure greys so those are provided at the bottom.
